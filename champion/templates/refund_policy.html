        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>Thank you for choosing The Champions Club. We strive to offer the best possible service and provide valuable educational content. However, we understand that there may be situations where you might seek a refund. This policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds are granted and the process for requesting a refund.</p>

        <h2>1. No Refunds for Consumed Services</h2>
        <p>Once a service, such as a video course, has been consumed, it is considered delivered and completed. As such, no refunds will be issued for consumed services. We encourage you to carefully review course descriptions, previews, and any available free content before making a purchase to ensure it meets your expectations.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
        <p>You may be eligible for a refund under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Issues During Payment:</strong> If you experience a technical issue during the payment process that results in an overcharge or incorrect billing, please contact our support team immediately. We will investigate the issue and, if a technical error is confirmed, a full refund will be issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Not Provided:</strong> If you have paid for a service but it has not been provided to you, please reach out to us with your payment details and a description of the issue. If our team confirms that the service was not delivered as promised, we will issue a full refund.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>

            <li><strong>Refund Decision:</strong> If your refund request is approved, the refund will be processed using the original payment method.
